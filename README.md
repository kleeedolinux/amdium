**AMDium - Boost Minecraft Performance with FSR Magic**  

**What is AMDium?**  
AMDium is a Fabric mod that brings AMDâ€™s FSR tech to Minecraft, giving your game a smooth performance boost without making it look blocky or blurry. Think of it as a clever "zoom and enhance" trick for your GPUâ€”renders the game at a lower resolution but keeps it looking sharp on your screen.  

**Why Youâ€™ll Love It**  
- **Smoother FPS**: Perfect for potato PCs or maxing out shaders.  
- **Crisp Visuals**: Smart upscaling keeps edges clean (no jagged trees!).  
- **Tweak It Your Way**: Adjust sharpness or let it auto-enable when your FPS drops.  
- **Easy to Use**: Toggle on/off with a single keypress (F10, baby!).  

**Pick Your Performance Mode**  
- **Ultra Quality**: "My PCâ€™s decent, but I want extra frames." (â‰ˆ30% FPS boost)  
- **Quality**: "I need a balance between pretty and smooth." (â‰ˆ50% FPS boost)  
- **Balanced**: "The sweet spot for most players." (â‰ˆ70% FPS boost)  
- **Performance**: "My PC is wheezingâ€”help!" (Double your FPS!)  
- **Ultra Performance**: "Iâ€™m playing on a toaster." (Triple FPS for emergencies)  

**Getting Started**  
1. **Install Fabric** for Minecraft 1.20.1 ([guide here](https://fabricmc.net/use/)).  
2. **Drag and Drop**: Download [AMDium](your-mod-link) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) into your `mods` folder.  
3. **Launch Minecraft** and play!

**Pro Tips**  
- **Sharpness Slider**: Default is 0.7. Crank it up for crispy textures, dial it down if things look grainy.  
- **Auto-Rescue Mode**: Let AMDium kick in automatically when your FPS tanks.  
- **Fullscreen? Yes!** Works best in native resolution.  

**Uh-Oh, Fixes!**  
- **Blurry or glitchy?** Try lowering sharpness or restarting the game.  
- **FSR turned off randomly?** Smash that `F10` key to resurrect it.  

**Credits & Shoutouts**  
- Thanks to **AMD** for the FSR magic.  
- Big love to the **Fabric team** and the Minecraft modding community for keeping the blocky dream alive.
